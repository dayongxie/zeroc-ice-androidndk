This demo is a minimal Ice "hello world" application. Each time the
client is run a "sayHello" invocation is sent to the server.

To run the demo, first you need to start the Ice minimal server. This
distribution includes server implementations in Python and C++, and
each one has its own README file with instructions for starting the
server. Please refer to the Python or C++ README in the appropriate
demo subdirectory for more information.

Note:

 * To use the Python server you'll need a Python installation that is
   compatible with the Ice for Python module included in Ice 3.5.1.

 * To use the C++ server you'll need a C++ compiler compatible with
   the Ice 3.5.1 C++ distribution.

After starting the server, open a separate window and start the
client:

$ node Client.js

Note that this demo hardwires port 10000. If port 10000 is not
available on your machine, you need to edit both client and server
to use a free port.
