A simple throughput demo that allows you to send sequences of various
types between client and server and to measure the maximum bandwidth
that can be achieved using serialized synchronous requests.

To run the demo, first you need to start the Ice throughput server.
This distribution includes server implementations in Python and C++,
and each one has its own README file with instructions for starting
the server. Please refer to the Python or C++ README in the
appropriate demo subdirectory for more information.

Note:

 * To use the Python server you'll need a Python installation that is
   compatible with the Ice for Python module included in Ice 3.5.1.

 * To use the C++ server you'll need a C++ compiler compatible with
   the Ice 3.5.1 C++ distribution.

After starting the server, open a separate window and start the
client:

$ node Client.js

The performance for byte sequences is expected to be greater than
for other types because the cost of marshaling and unmarshaling is
lower than for more complex types.
