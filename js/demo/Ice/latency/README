A simple latency test that measures the basic call dispatch delay of
Ice.

To run the demo, first you need to start the Ice latency server. This
distribution includes server implementations in Python and C++, and
each one has its own README file with instructions for starting the
server. Please refer to the Python or C++ README in the appropriate
demo subdirectory for more information.

Note:

 * To use the Python server you'll need a Python installation that is
   compatible with the Ice for Python module included in Ice 3.5.1.

 * To use the C++ server you'll need a C++ compiler compatible with
   the Ice 3.5.1 C++ distribution.

After starting the server, open a separate window and start the
client:

$ node Client.js
