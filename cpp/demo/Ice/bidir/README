This demo shows how to use bidirectional connections for callbacks.
This is typically used if the server cannot open a connection to the
client to send callbacks, for example, because firewalls block
incoming connections to the client.

To run the demo, first start the server:

$ server

In a separate window, start the client:

$ client
